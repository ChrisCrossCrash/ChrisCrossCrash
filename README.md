### Full stack web developer with an emphasis on front-end React

The world of web development has always been a rapidly changing environment. We will never run out of new things to learn and new challenges to overcome. This is exactly what attracted me to web development in the first place. I'm at my best when I'm learning new things and sharing knowledge with other people. The following sections mostly give an overview of my "book knowledge" and experience, but my passion for learning is my greatest asset.

## Portfolio

- [**MLK Seminars**](https://www.mlkseminars.com) - A place where electrical industry professionals sign up and pay for in-person training seminars. The site has a Next.js front end and a Django Rest Framework back end. Payments are processed by Stripe.
- [**ChrisKumm.com**](https://www.chriskumm.com) - This is where I showcase my work. The site has a Next.js front end and a custom Telegram integration for receiving contact form messages.
- [r/Place Python and Blender Data Visualization](https://github.com/ChrisCrossCrash/r-place-blender) - Scripts and Jupyter Notesbooks for r/Place data visualization with Blender and Python.
- [**InstaArt**](https://insta-art-frontend.vercel.app/) - An online art museum. The site has a Next.js front end and a Django Rest Framework back end.
- [**Depth Section**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depth-section) - An open source NPM package for easily adding 3D parallax backgrounds to your site.
- Much more - I'm always tinkering around with new ideas and experiments. Please check out my GitHub repositories to get an idea what I'm working on.

## Skills

- **Git best practices** - Effectively using Git makes it easier to work with other people and understand changes in source code.
- **Test Driven Development** - Writing tests helps keep me sane. It keeps me from breaking things in my projects, and it doubles as documentation.
- **3D modeling and animation** - For stunning visual effects and a playful element of interactivity.

## Tech Stack

My stack is constantly evolving and I love to learn new things. Nowadays, it typically includes:

- **React Typescript** (Next.js)
- **Django with Django REST Framework** (if a database or back-end functionality is needed)
- **Vercel** (for hosting the front-end React project)
- **Ubuntu Server** (for the back-end Django server)
